### Portfolio Projects

*A curated selection of projects demonstrating my skills in data engineering, predictive analytics, and business intelligence. All projects use publicly available, de-identified data.*

#### Project 1: Predictive Modeling for Heart Disease Risk
* **Description:** This project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical attributes. The analysis involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships, data preprocessing including encoding and scaling, and the implementation of various classification algorithms. The final output includes a comparative evaluation of models like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with a focus on identifying the most accurate predictive model. The insights derived help in understanding key risk factors associated with heart failure.
* **Skills Showcased:** Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Model Building & Evaluation

#### Project 2: dbt ETL build to modularize a patient profile report built in SQL
* **Description:** A dbt model that takes a SQL view creating a multi-faceted patient profile predicting churn with demographics data and modularizing it with dbt.
* **Skills Showcased:** dbt, SQL, Data Modeling
* **[Link to Repository](https://github.com/dansarmiento/dbt_data_build_tool)**

#### Project 3: Machine Learning Modeling for Mental Health
* **Description:** This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline in Python to predict the likelihood of depression based on a range of lifestyle and demographic factors. It showcases the use of Pandas for data wrangling and a scikit-learn pipeline with a ColumnTransformer to handle imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding for mixed data types before training and evaluating a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
* **Skills Showcased:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Naive Bayes, Data Visualization
